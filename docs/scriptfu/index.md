Here I have snippets of code and commands for my reference. Maybe others can find some things helpful as well. 

I will try to add official sources for documentation on each one of these pages (work in progress). Please, if you have found yourself here somehow and not already familiar, please take the time to follow the official documentation. This is more for ideas and examples.

Two other better sources for examples are:

  * [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh) Example, run:  `curl cht.sh/iptables`
  * [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) Example, run (once installed) `tldr nmap`
